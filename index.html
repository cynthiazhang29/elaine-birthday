        <button onclick="openPoem(`Morning folds itself around the window glass,
the faint hum of sprinklers rising with the pale light.
Steam from the kettle blurs the jar of honey,
and dust motes float like something remembered.
Outside, a crow slides across the almond tree’s bare limb,
and the sky, still undecided, holds both blue and grey.
From somewhere unseen, a child’s laughter carries—
light, quick, fading into the street like breath on glass.
Once, we danced and sang our way through that season,  
voices tumbling into the humid dusk,  
the air all hay and asphalt, echo and hush.  
Now the kettle hums; its lid jitters, eager.  
I pour the tea too early.
It scalds the cup, curls steam toward the glass,
and in it, I see the faintest ghost of your grin—
half sunlight, half challenge—how you’d wait,
then say something that rewrote the silence.
Time has traveled long since then,
but sometimes, when wind swings the gate just so,
I hear our old rhythm returning:
the sound of two voices moving through schoolyards,
through laughter, through everything we didn’t yet name.
The day folds around the edges, patient.
Somewhere, you are stirring sugar into your own quiet,
and I imagine the windows there catching light
in the same forgiving way.
